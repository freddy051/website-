        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>Dear Students,</p>
        <p>
        At elite universities, students are often told that there are only a few set paths to success, and that deviating from these paths puts you at a disadvantage...
        </p>
        <p>
        However, many students fail to recognize the inherent value in simply being at a top-tier university and having a solid resume...
        </p>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>It is possible to get a prestigious finance job with no networking and no prior finance experience.</li>
            <li>Companies aren’t looking to hire Albert Einstein. They’re hiring a 23-year-old kid. The bar for excellence is not that high.</li>
            <li>You may not actually end up being happy with the job you’ve been working so hard to get.</li>
            <li>You could have a 2.5 GPA and a thin resume and 99% of entry-level jobs would still consider you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I work with students at every stage of their college journey...</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br>Harold Bergner</p>
