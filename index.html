            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Dear Students,</p>
            <p>At elite universities, students are often told that there are only a few set paths to success, and that deviating from these paths puts you at a disadvantage. Take, for example, the pressure many students feel to decide on a career in investment banking by the start of their sophomore year, or the constant pressure to network relentlessly to secure a job. The message is clear: if you don’t commit to one of these paths early enough, you’ll be left behind.</p>
            <p>However, many students fail to recognize the inherent value in simply being at a top-tier university and having a solid resume. These credentials alone can make them competitive for a wide variety of roles. It’s often the students who should be the least worried who worry the most—I know because I was one of them.</p>
            <p>I’m starting Harold Bergner Career Counseling because I want to help students alleviate the stress that comes with career planning. College is the best time of your life. You’re old enough to start to have an identity but young enough to not have the weight of real-world responsibilities. Outside of class and studying, it should be spent socializing and exploring genuine areas of interest, not forcing yourself to do things you don’t want to just to get “ahead” in your career.</p>
            <p>While university career counselors can offer valuable guidance in some cases, they often present the recruitment process as a formula – do X, Y, and Z, and with your grades and resume, you’ll land the job. The truth? There’s no formula, and luck plays a huge role in landing any job offer.</p>
            <ul class="context-list">
                <li>It is possible to get a prestigious finance job with no networking and no prior finance experience.</li>
                <li>Companies aren’t looking to hire Albert Einstein. They’re hiring a 23-year-old kid. The bar for excellence is not that high.</li>
                <li>You may not actually end up being happy with the job you’ve been working so hard to get (a friend of mine has already switched and two are actively trying to).</li>
                <li>You could have a 2.5 GPA and a thin resume and 99% of entry-level jobs would consider you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I work with students at every stage of their college journey. For freshmen and sophomores, we focus on how your major and course selection can guide your career exploration. For juniors and seniors, the focus shifts to tactical strategies for landing interviews and securing job offers.</p>
            <p>My rates are significantly cheaper than the so-called “experts,” and I am offering free 30-minute consultations. How we work together will depend on what you need — some students may want regular live sessions, while others might just have occasional questions here and there. If you're interested in my services, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>
            <p>Sincerely, <br> Harold Bergner</p>

My goal is to reduce the unnecessary stress around the job hunt and bring real-world perspective to the process. I combine personal experience with a strategic mindset to offer tailored guidance that makes sense for where you are now, not just a "one-size-fits-all" formula.</p>
