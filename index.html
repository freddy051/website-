        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>Dear Students,</p>
        <p>At elite universities, students are often told there are only a few paths to success. The pressure to follow these paths—whether investment banking, consulting, or tech—can be overwhelming. I've been there.</p>
        <p>I'm starting Harold Bergner Career Counseling to help students step back, breathe, and recognize the value they already bring. College should be about exploration, not just resume building.</p>
        <p>University career offices often present success as a formula: do X, Y, Z and you'll land the job. Reality is much messier—and that's okay. What I offer is hard-earned context: a broader view of career success and the many paths that lead there.</p>
        <ul class="highlights">
            <li>✅ You don't need prior finance experience to land a top finance role.</li>
            <li>✅ Companies hire people, not superhumans. The bar isn't as high as you think.</li>
            <li>✅ You might not love the "dream job" you worked so hard to get — and that's normal.</li>
            <li>✅ You can succeed even with a 2.5 GPA and minimal experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you're picking classes, applying for jobs, or just feeling stuck — I'm here to help you move forward with clarity and confidence.</p>
        <p>Sincerely, <br> Harold Bergner</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Harold Bergner. After graduating from a top university and navigating the complex world of recruiting, I realized most students don't lack talent — they lack perspective. I'm passionate about offering honest, practical advice that goes beyond rehearsed scripts and checklists.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love basketball, cooking, and mentoring students one-on-one. I started HB Counseling to bring a human-centered, stress-reducing approach to career planning.</p>
