    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Dear Students,</p>
    <p>At elite universities, students are often told that there are only a few set paths to success...</p>
    <p>However, many students fail to recognize the inherent value in simply being at a top-tier university...</p>
    <p>While university career counselors can offer valuable guidance, they often present the recruitment process as a formula...</p>
    <p>What I offer to students that university career counselors cannot is context — context that is impossible to have while going through the process...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is possible to get a prestigious finance job with no networking and no prior finance experience.</li>
      <li>Companies aren’t looking to hire Albert Einstein. They’re hiring a 23-year-old kid.</li>
      <li>You may not actually end up being happy with the job you’ve been working so hard to get.</li>
      <li>You could have a 2.5 GPA and still be considered for 99% of entry-level jobs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I work with students at every stage of their college journey...</p>
    <p>And remember — you got this!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Harold Bergner</p>
